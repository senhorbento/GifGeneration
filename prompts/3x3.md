### Creating the first sprite
Create a detailed pixel art sprite for a game, use the guy in the photo as a base. 
I need a basic pose with full body to use in frames generation later.
The image should have a blank background.

### Prompt 

Keep the uploaded guy image as a base for the wizard
Create a detailed pixel art animation for a game, divided clearly into a 3x3 grid (each individual frame exactly 300px by 300px), forming a continuous 9-frame animation sequence.

Depict a wizard performing a spellcasting sequence, beginning with intricate hand motions, conjuring a vibrant fireball, and concluding with the dramatic release of the spell. Ensure each keyframe transitions smoothly and continuously into the next, clearly illustrating the wizard’s action.

Frame Sequence and Layout:  
Frames should be arranged from left-to-right, top-to-bottom:

Row 1: Frames 1 → 2 → 3  
Row 2: Frames 4 → 5 → 6  
Row 3: Frames 7 → 8 → 9


Detailed Frame-by-Frame Description:  

- Frame 1: Wizard standing idle, hands lowered naturally at sides.
- Frame 2: Wizard begins raising both hands upward, initiating the spell.
- Frame 3: Hands fully raised; a small glowing fireball starting to form between the palms.
- Frame 4: Fireball glow intensifies significantly, clearly visible between wizard’s hands.
- Frame 5: Fireball fully formed, bright and vibrant, floating prominently between wizard’s palms.
- Frame 6: Wizard starts pushing hands forward, actively casting the fireball outward.
- Frame 7: Fireball clearly leaving the wizard’s hands, trailing vibrant streams of energy.
- Frame 8: Fireball mid-air, glowing intensely, fully separated from wizard.
- Frame 9: Fireball reaches far-right edge of frame; wizard slightly leaned forward, clearly completing the spellcasting motion.
