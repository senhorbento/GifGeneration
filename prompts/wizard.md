### Creating the first sprite
Create a detailed pixel art sprite for a game, use the guy in the photo as a base. 
I need a basic pose with full body to use in frames generation later.

### Prompt 1

Ensure character maintains the exact same proportions, pixel art style (16-bit), color palette, lighting, outfit, facial features, and centered screen position as the uploaded frame.
Create a detailed pixel art animation for a game, divided clearly into a 3x3 grid (each individual frame exactly 300px by 300px), forming a continuous 9-frame animation sequence of a wizards's fire spell cast build-up.

Art Style:
Maintain 16-bit pixel art style throughout with consistent lighting (top-left light source), pixel-level shading, and no variation in robe or staff design.

Frame 1: Idle pose — staff down, neutral expression.
Frame 2: Slight lean back; robe begins shifting.
Frame 3: Left hand starts lifting the staff.
Frame 4: Staff halfway up, eyes focus forward.
Frame 5: Staff above chest height, orb glows faintly.
Frame 6: Staff almost fully raised; fire particles begin forming.
Frame 7: Glow intensifies; feet brace.
Frame 8: Wizard’s face turns stern; fire begins circling orb.
Frame 9: Final wind-up pose — staff high, glow pulsing, fire swirling.

Ensure each keyframe transitions smoothly and continuously into the next, clearly illustrating the Druid action. 

Frame Sequence:   
Frames should be arranged from left-to-right, top-to-bottom:

Row 1: Frames 1 → 2 → 3  
Row 2: Frames 4 → 5 → 6  
Row 3: Frames 7 → 8 → 9
