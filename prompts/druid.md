### Creating the first sprite
Create a detailed pixel art sprite for a game, use the guy in the photo as a base. 
I need a basic pose with full body to use in frames generation later.
The image should have a blank background.

### Prompt 1
Ensure character maintains exact same proportions, style, colors, and position as previous sprite.
Create a detailed pixel art animation for a game, divided clearly into a 3x3 grid (each individual frame exactly 300px by 300px), forming a continuous 9-frame animation sequence.

Frames 1–3: Druid stands still, trees gently swaying, arms beginning to rise.
Frames 4–6: Leaves swirl, mouth moves in slow chant, magical energy builds.
Frames 7–9: Vines shoot from the earth in spirals, reaching outward.

Ensure each keyframe transitions smoothly and continuously into the next, clearly illustrating the Druid action. 

Frame Sequence:   
Frames should be arranged from left-to-right, top-to-bottom:

Row 1: Frames 1 → 2 → 3  
Row 2: Frames 4 → 5 → 6  
Row 3: Frames 7 → 8 → 9

### Prompt 2

Ensure character maintains exact same proportions, style, colors, and position as previous sprite.
Create a detailed pixel art animation for a game, divided clearly into a 3x3 grid (each individual frame exactly 300px by 300px), forming a continuous 9-frame animation sequence.

Frames 1–3: Flowers bloom quickly along the vines and around the druid.
Frames 4–6: A bright, green pulse of energy radiates from their chest.
Frames 7–9: Energy expands into a shimmering, protective dome over allies.

Ensure each keyframe transitions smoothly and continuously into the next, clearly illustrating the Druid action. 

Frame Sequence:   
Frames should be arranged from left-to-right, top-to-bottom:

Row 1: Frames 1 → 2 → 3  
Row 2: Frames 4 → 5 → 6
