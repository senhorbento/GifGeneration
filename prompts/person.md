### Creating the first sprite
Please generate a full-body sprite based on the person in the photo.
I need a clean, front-facing 2D game sprite in a neutral base pose, for animation use later.
The character should have no facial expression, no action, and the pose should be symmetrical and relaxed.

Pose details:

Arms angled down about 45°, relaxed at the sides
Feet shoulder-width apart
Hands relaxed and visible
Head facing forward
Legs straight and slightly apart
Output as a clean cartoon-style sprite, suitable for use in a side-scrolling 2D game.
Please use a transparent background.

### Description of the image generated

A clean, cartoon-style full-body sprite of a young man is shown standing in a neutral, symmetrical pose against a plain background. He has medium-light skin, long and voluminous curly dark brown hair that spreads outward, and wears rectangular black glasses. His expression is neutral, with straight eyebrows and a relaxed mouth. He has subtle facial hair, including a mustache and a short beard along the jawline.

The character is dressed in a red and black horizontal-striped Flamengo football jersey, complete with the Nike logo and the club’s crest (CRF) on the chest. He wears simple black pants and plain black shoes. His arms are angled downward at about 45 degrees and rest naturally at his sides with relaxed hands. His feet are shoulder-width apart, and his posture is straight and balanced, making it ideal for animation in a side-scrolling 2D game.

### Prompt 1
Use the uploaded character as the base for a wizard. Create a 9-frame animation, arranged in a 3x3 grid, with each frame exactly 300x300 pixels and a transparent background, designed for a 2D side-scrolling game.

Animation Sequence:
The wizard notices a glowing magical sunflower descending from above and catches it with an expressive and readable motion. The sunflower emits a soft glow and faint magical particles.

Frame Breakdown:

Frame 1: Wizard standing idle, arms relaxed at sides, facing forward.
Frame 2: Wizard shifts attention upward, eyes slightly angled toward the sky.
Frame 3: Right arm begins to lift, hand turning palm-up in anticipation.
Frame 4: Right hand halfway raised, fingers gently opening.
Frame 5: Magical sunflower enters from above, glowing softly, trailing sparkles.
Frame 6: Sunflower floats above open palm, glow intensifies.
Frame 7: Sunflower lands in hand; fingers begin curling around it.
Frame 8: Hand fully grasps sunflower; glow pulses; expression softens.
Frame 9: Arm retracts slightly, sunflower brought closer to the chest.

Art Style:

Detailed cartoon style (not chibi)
Pixel-level shading and clean linework
Consistent top-left lighting
Character retains hairstyle, glasses, and color palette from reference
Sunflower glows softly with a radiant center and faint particles
Robe and potential staff design must remain consistent across all frames
Keep the wizard visible and consistent across all frames.
Position the sunflower clearly above or just over the palm, never overlapping or replacing any part.
Emphasize the glow effect and sparkles without obscuring important features.

Grid Layout:
3x3 grid (frames 10–18)
Each frame exactly 300px by 300px
Transparent background
Sequence must be a seamless continuation of the previous grid

Frame Sequence:  
Frames should be arranged from left-to-right, top-to-bottom:

Row 1: Frames 1 → 2 → 3  
Row 2: Frames 4 → 5 → 6  
Row 3: Frames 7 → 8 → 9

### Prompt 2
Continue the animation sequence of the wizard (based on the uploaded character), depicting frames 10 through 18 of the magical sunflower interaction. Use the same character design, art style, and grid layout as in frames 1–9.

Animation Continuation:

Frame 10: The wizard brings the glowing magical sunflower closer to their chest with both hands.
Frame 11: Wizard gently holds the sunflower near the chest; soft magical particles drift around it.
Frame 12: Wizard looks down slightly at the sunflower, a subtle emotional moment.
Frame 13: Wizard begins to extend the sunflower forward again, both hands supporting it.
Frame 14: Sunflower halfway extended, glowing more intensely; gentle sparkles swirl.
Frame 15: Wizard fully extends arms, presenting the magical sunflower; light radiates outward.
Frame 16: Final pose held; sunflower shines brightly, soft aura visible; wizard wears a gentle smile.
Frame 17: Subtle motion—slight upward body bounce or shift to add life to the idle pose.
Frame 18: Wizard holds the final offering pose, sunflower still glowing; pose stable and loop-ready.

Art Style:

Detailed cartoon style (not chibi)
Pixel-level shading and clean linework
Consistent top-left lighting
Character appearance must perfectly match frames 1–9 (hair, robe, glasses, etc.)
Sunflower continues glowing with magical particles and visual consistency
No sudden style shifts, costume changes, or added props
Character retains hairstyle, glasses, and color palette from reference
Robe and potential staff design must remain consistent across all frames
Position the sunflower clearly above or just over the palm, never overlapping or replacing any part.
Emphasize the glow effect and sparkles without obscuring important features.

Grid Layout:
3x3 grid (frames 10–18)
Each frame exactly 300px by 300px
Transparent background
Sequence must be a seamless continuation of the previous grid

Frame Sequence:  
Frames should be arranged from left-to-right, top-to-bottom:

Row 1: Frames 1 → 2 → 3  
Row 2: Frames 4 → 5 → 6  
Row 3: Frames 7 → 8 → 9
